                stock. Tipigo collects analyst data from multiple reliable
                sources and presents only curated ratings from our selected
                analyst team.

                  Our Portfolio Management Tool is designed to provide you with
                  a comprehensive solution to track and manage your market
                  decisions over time. With this tool, you will have the ability
                  to monitor your portfolio's performance and evaluate how you
                  are doing compared to a selected market.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the key features of the Portfolio Management Tool is
                  the ability to track the performance of your portfolio on a
                  daily basis. By monitoring the unit price of your assets, you
                  can easily assess the progress of your investments and make
                  informed decisions based on real-time updates
                </p>

                <p>
                  The tool also offers full action logs, allowing you to keep a
                  record of all your activities such as adding or withdrawing
                  funds, adding or removing positions, and updating positions.
                  This feature ensures transparency and accountability, enabling
                  you to review your actions and make adjustments as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, the Portfolio Management Tool provides a
                  comprehensive view of the return rate for all your assets,
                  including long positions, short positions, and cash positions.
                  You can compare your portfolio's performance against
                  benchmarks, giving you valuable insights into your investment
                  strategy and overall market trends.

                        To begin, you need to add funds to your portfolio. Click
                        on the "$" sign to add funds to your portfolio. You can
                        enter the amount of funds you want to add to your
                        portfolio. You would be able to use this option in
                        future to make adjustments to your portfolio's capital
                        based on changes in your investment strategy or
                        financial needs. All fund transactions, including
                        additions and withdrawals, are logged and presented in
                        the fund history for your reference and record keeping.

                        The amount you add will be translated into the initial
                        unit price, which is set at 1 USD by default. This
                        initial unit price serves as a reference point for
                        tracking the performance of your investments. (!) Note:
                        when recording the first deposit in the fund history
                        audit log, ensure that the date of the deposit is
                        earlier than the date of your first opened positions.
                        This chronological order is important to accurately
                        reflect the sequence of events in your portfolio.

                        which it was acquired. This information allows the tool

                        If you prefer that Tipigo would find and suggest
                        investment opportunities, we recommend using the
                        Opportunity Scanner tool, located under the "Tools"
                        section. The Opportunity Scanner uses advanced
                        algorithms to analyze analyst and market data and
                        identify potential investment opportunities that match
                        your criteria.

                        Please note that by default, the system is not directly
                        connected to a trading service. Therefore, in order to
                        maintain accurate portfolio numbers, you will need to
                        manually enter the exact figures from your trading
                        system or brokerage account. This ensures that your
                        portfolio reflects your actual holdings and provides
                        accurate performance calculations.

                        This Add Position screen allows you to specify the type
                        of investment, whether it's a buy (long) or sell (short)
                        position. You can enter symbols for stocks or ETFs, and
                        once accepted, they will be displayed in green.

                        For each position, enter the symbol, quantity, and

                        market value based on the symbol entered. However, it's
                        important to adjust the market value according to the
                        actual figures from your trading system or brokerage
                        account. This ensures that your portfolio reflects
                        accurate and up-to-date information.

                      The Daily P&L (Profit and Loss) provides you with a
                      measure of the daily gains or losses in your portfolio's
                      value. It represents the change in the value of your
                      portfolio on a day-to-day basis, helping you track the
                      performance and fluctuations of your investments over
                      time.

                      The Sharpe Ratio is a metric that assesses the
                      risk-adjusted return of your portfolio. It measures the
                      excess return generated by your portfolio compared to a
                      risk-free investment, relative to the volatility of the
                      portfolio. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better
                      risk-adjusted performance, as it signifies higher returns
                      for the amount of risk taken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Sharpe Ratio calculations are based on the performance
                      of your portfolio over a three-month period. They provide
                      valuable insights into risk characteristics of your
                      investments, allowing you to evaluate and analyze the
                      performance of your portfolio.

                      symbol closely for further analysis or potential
                      adjustments to their portfolio.

                      Symbol price below MA100: <br />
                      Similar to the previous event, this monitoring event
                      occurs when the price of a symbol drops below its 100-day
                      moving average (MA100). It indicates that the current
                      price is lower than the average price observed over the
                      past 100 days. This event may signal a more significant
                      shift in the symbol's trend or potential long-term
                      weakness, warranting further attention and analysis.

                      Symbol earning date nearing: <br />
                      This event notifies users when the earning date for a
                      symbol is approaching. The earning date refers to the
                      scheduled date on which a company will release its
                      financial results, including revenue, earnings, and other
                      key metrics. Monitoring this event allows investors to
                      stay informed about upcoming earnings announcements, which
                      can impact the market perception and potentially influence
                      the price and performance of the symbol. Being aware of
                      the earning date enables investors to plan their actions
                      and evaluate the potential implications on their
                      investment decisions.

                      The Sharpe Ratio is a metric that assesses the
                      risk-adjusted return of your portfolio. It measures the
                      excess return generated by your portfolio compared to a
                      risk-free investment, relative to the volatility of the
                      portfolio. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better
                      risk-adjusted performance, as it signifies higher returns
                      for the amount of risk taken.

                        Please remember that closing a position involves selling
                        or liquidating the investment, thereby removing it from
                        your portfolio. It is crucial to carefully evaluate and

                        account your investment strategy, objectives, and market

                          The ability to edit a position may depend on the
                          specific features and capabilities of your portfolio.

                          The changes made through the "Edit Position" option
                          typically reflect updates within the portfolio
                          management tool itself. Ensure that any corresponding
                          changes or adjustments are also made in your trading
                          system or other sources of record to maintain accurate
                          data.

                        <li>
                          Review your edits carefully before confirming, as any
                          modifications made will affect the position's

                          certain fields or parameters. If you encounter any
                          limitations, reach out to your portfolio management

                          comparing your position's performance to the
                          benchmark, you can gain valuable insights into the

                      The funds history audit log serves as a record of all the
                      actions and events that have occurred in your portfolio.
                      It captures details such as the type of action, date and
                      time, units or shares involved, unit price, amount, and
                      any additional comments. By scrolling to the bottom of the
                      page, you can access the fund history and review the
                      chronological list of recorded actions. The fund history
                      log is a valuable resource for tracking and auditing the
                      changes and transactions made in your portfolio. It helps
                      you maintain an accurate record of your portfolio's
                      activity and provides transparency and accountability for
                      all actions taken.
